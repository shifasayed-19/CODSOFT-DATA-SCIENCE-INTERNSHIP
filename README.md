# CODSOFT-DATA-SCIENCE-INTERNSHIP
During my CODSOFT internship, I worked on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning using Python. I built models like Random Forest and XGBoost, validated them, and documented insights. This hands-on experience strengthened my skills in real-world data science projects.
